### Overview
The `ShopRMoveEffect` component is used to make parts of your shop move using a list of preset animations. This effect is used to make the model move in a specific direction when the user interacts with it.

Effects are divided into 3 categories:
- **Move**: Animates the object's position.
- **Rotate**: Animates the object's rotation.
- **Particles**: Plays a particle effect.

Simply add the `ShopRMoveEffect` component to any object in your scene and select the desired effect from the dropdown menu.
