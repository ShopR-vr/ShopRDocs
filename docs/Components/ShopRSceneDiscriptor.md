## What does this do?

The `ShopRSceneDiscriptor` component is used to describe your scene and provide information about it to the ShopR platform. This component is required for all scenes uploaded to the ShopR platform.

The object this component is attached to will be used as the spawn point for the user when they enter the scene. The user will be placed at the position of the object and will be facing the same direction as the +Z axis of the object.
