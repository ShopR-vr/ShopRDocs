## What does this do?

This component tells ShopR to treat this model as a product. This will allow users to interact with the product and add it to their cart.

## How do I do this?

:::warning
Your product must exist in the ShopR backend for this process to work. Please reach out to the ShopR Team to do this if you have not already
:::

1. Add your product model to the scene.
