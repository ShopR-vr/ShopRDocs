# Prerequisites

Before you can upload virtual showrooms to the ShopR platform, there are a few essential steps to set up your development environment. Let’s make sure you’ve got everything you need!

## What You’ll Need

To get started, you’ll require the following:

- **ShopR Seller Account**  
  If you’re here, you likely already have one. If not, you can request one from the ShopR team. (More on that below!)
  :::tip Need Access?
  ShopR seller accounts and SDK access are provided by the ShopR team on an individual basis. If you don’t have an account or access to the [ShopR SDK Package](https://github.com/ShopR-vr/ShopR-SDK-Package), please reach out to the ShopR team.
  :::
- **GitHub Account**  
  Ensure your GitHub account has access to the [ShopR SDK Package](https://github.com/ShopR-vr/ShopR-SDK-Package) repository. This package contains the tools you’ll need to create and upload showrooms.

- **Unity Experience**  
  You should have basic knowledge of using Unity, as it’s the primary tool for creating virtual showrooms.

- **Unity Hub**  
  Download and install [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe) to manage your Unity projects and installations.

- **Unity 2022.3.12f1**  
  Make sure to download **Unity 2022.3.12f1** from the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).  
  :::warning Important!  
  You must use **Unity 2022.3.12f1** for ShopR projects. Using a different version may result in unexpected behavior or failure to upload your showroom.
  :::
  :::tip Quick Download  
  If you have Unity Hub installed, you can click [this link](unityhub://2022.3.12f1/4fe6e059c7ef) to launch Unity Hub and download the correct version automatically.  
  :::  

- **Git**  
  Git is required to interact with the ShopR SDK repository. If you don’t already have Git installed, grab it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you’ll be ready to start creating and uploading your virtual showrooms to the ShopR platform!
